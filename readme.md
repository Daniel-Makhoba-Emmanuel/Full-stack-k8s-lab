# Full Stack K8S Lab 

## Where to start?
If you're looking to understand the structure and maintenance of this lab, your first stop should be the `Lab` directory. It contains all the manifests for the lab.

For insights into my thought process during development, you can refer to the docs website, https://daniel-makhoba-emmanuel.github.io/Full-stack-k8s-lab/, where you'll find my `CHANGELOG`, `openSource tools used` and `Problems and solution faced` files.

## Workloads
These are the workloads that are currently in the Lab. For more information about upcoming workloads you can check `CHANGELOG.md`

- Go (backend)
