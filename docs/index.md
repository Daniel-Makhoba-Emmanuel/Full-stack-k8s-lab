# Welcome to My Kubernetes Production Lab

Hello!, I'm Daniel Makhoba Emmanuel, a Kubernetes Engineer with years of experience in technology and a track record in Fullstack Engineering, DevOps and Cloud Native. 

I made this lab to not only upskill my kubernetes skills, but also document the process. In this Lab I experiment with different Opensource tools, AI, cloud-providers, essentially any technology I find and feel like "Hey this would be pretty nice to test out or use in an organization", and if it works I add it to my toolset.

You can reach out through any of the following, even if it's to just make a new connection:
